### Situation

MAAM Winery located in California is looking to expand its earning and opportunities by introducing an organic wine product into the market. The CFO is requesting this Project Team to measure the impact of the alcoholic beverages sector on the earnings of several brewers, wineries and distilleries. The following 3 ETFs: BUD, TWE.AX, and CWGL have been selected to conduct our financial analysis. 

### Complications
The company has experienced very high volatility of earnings in the winery and distillery sector. There is increased competition in these and their substitute and complementary markets. New sustainable, organic products are increasingly successful in entering the market and leveraging the demand among new and existing consumers. The company needs to determine if adding a new product to their current portfolio of offerings is a profitable business decision.
